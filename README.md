# AssaultCube_shitbot
absolute POS aimbot, with some other functionality thrown in
- buggy ass graphics when aimbot is enabled (L)
- nospread + rapid fire (not toggleable lol) (O)
- refil reserve ammo to 9999 (0)
- double jump(ish) (P)
- print a lobby entity names (N)

none of these work perfectly, either they function mostly as intended, or when intended, but never both at the same time
moving on to bigger and better things because honestly im tired of AC
