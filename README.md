# AssaultCube_shitbot
--INACTIVE--
absolute POS aimbot, with some other functionality thrown in
- buggy ass graphics when aimbot is enabled (L)
- nospread + rapid fire (not toggleable lol) (O)
- refil reserve ammo to 9999 (0)
- double jump(ish) (P)
- print a lobby entity names (N)

To use this DLL
1. install assault cube 1.3.0.2
2. install Process Hacker or any other program that lets you inject DLLs
3. download the newDLL1 folder
4. open assault cube and process hacker
5. find the assault cube process in process hacker
6. left click, Misc->Inject DLL...
7. open newDLL1.dll in the Debug subfolder of the newDLL1 main folder
8. pray it doesnt crash

none of these work perfectly, either they function mostly as intended, or when intended, but never both at the same time
moving on to bigger and better things because honestly im tired of AC
